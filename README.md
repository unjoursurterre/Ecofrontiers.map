# Ecofrontiers ReFi Map

The [Ecofrontiers](https://ecofrontiers.xyz/) Map is an application enabling the discovery and trade of green crypto-assets across the planet. 

## Why is this repository empty?
Ecofrontiers has recently deployed a first functioning prototype of their ReFi Asset Map using Heroku. You may check it out here. While we remain working on developping the application further, the repository remains closed. However, transparency is important to us, and if you would like to request access to the source code of this prototype, you may reach out to louise@curvelabs.eu

## Vision üåç
Without substantial public and private investment, we won‚Äôt be able to protect the biosphere at the scale it needs. The emergent Web3 natural capital asset market is promising, but fractured. Assets are hard to find, and hard to trade. With its Map, [Ecofrontiers](https://mirror.xyz/ecofrontiers.eth/TYJd-4ktkw4gmpgPbxKIlgPCEloTKvT1fuVLIL_SiyQ) aims to offer an alternative to the current state of the decentralized environmental asset market, where:
* Projects tokenizing natural capital are in need of a clear and intuitive platform to display the location of their assets.
* Organizations, governments and individuals willing to buy tokenized natural capital are in need of a unified interface enabling asset discovery beyond carbon.
* Environmental projects aiming to tokenize natural capital are in need of a platform to show where they are operating and advertise their project.

## Solution üó∫Ô∏è
The Ecofrontiers Map is a location-based aggregation layer enabling the discovery and trade of tokenized environmental assets throughout the globe.
The Map is being developed in three phases:

1. Displaying of all tokenized natural capital assets, with description, asset type, and link to corresponding marketplace. The search is enhanced through a filter mechanism.
2. Projects aiming to tokenize natural capital can pin their projects to the map to expand their reach.
3. Enable the purchase of tokenized natural capital assets directly through the interface.

## What has been done so far üßë‚Äçüíª
A first functioning prototype of the Ecofrontiers Map has been deployed using Heroku. The team has developed this first version of the Map using MongoDB and Mapbox. The complete stack is JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Python. The Map displays eight different asset providers, and six asset types, for a total of 26 assets to discover. We also added a filtering feature that enables the search for specific assets according to their type, and issuer.

Beyond this map prototype, Ecofrontiers is a research and advocacy program to advance the potential of Web3 technologies in natural capital markets. Our first campaign and associated industry report, ‚ÄúNew Frontiers in Eco-Capitalism,‚Äù targets environmental policy-makers, green funds, and environmental projects to improve the conditions for natural capital production at scale. A [sample chapter](https://mirror.xyz/ecofrontiers.eth/zkh2LoADInAgr7GLbXnsuUOEcwJKFE4GuUSYuYU22io) unveiling the **first mapping of green crypto-assets** has been published on October 30th. This mapping serves as the basis for the classification of the assets displayed on the map.
